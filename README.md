# Flutrack backend
This system is a part of a master's thesis at NTNU, done by Martin Almvik and Mikael Rino Solstad. Work in progress!

## Purpose
The goal is to create a web application (angularJS frontend and Django backend) that will predict where the flu will spread. It uses twitter as a data source, and attempts to use machine learning to predict which tweets are cases of an influenza infection. Furthermore, the system will use flight traffic data, and an algorithm to calculate the risk of infection in cities connected via air traffic.

## Installation
Work in progress.
